ACCESS: Run game by running "Space Drifter" executable.
CONTROLS: Arrow keys fly and steer the ship, SPACE bar slows the ship down.

This is a minimal, sample C++ exercise using the Simple DirectMedia Layer library, primarily to familiarize myself with constructing software in an instance loop, iterating on user inputs, and devising some simple physics algorithms.

I may add to this project periodically to experiment with new design ideas, all for educational purposes.
All code and assets in this repository are made by me, no royalties etc etc.
